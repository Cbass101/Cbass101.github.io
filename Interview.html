            <p>Although it may just seem like a car with some nice rims, it's more than just that. Interviewing Antonio and his 2005 Nissan 350z you can see the true passion that he has for this car. As he spent so much of his time gathering money together from flipping Mazda Miatas to get the money to buy this car. Even then the car was still in need of some major repairs such as a new engine and installing the transmission.</p> 
            <img src="Images/InterviewPic2.JPG" alt="starter" width="1000" height="500">
            <p>Asking him why this car in particular? Antonio tells me  why he bought the car. Sure you can take this car to work, school, and back home. But there's no true fun in that. What the 350z’s main purpose is to drift. Antonio as well as others in the car community take cars much like the 350 to tracks in order for them to compete or just drift for the fun of it. With this car being cheap in the used car market as well as its 50/50 weight distribution, and  rear wheel drive it allows for the car to be able to actually be able to drift with some minor adjustments to it.</p> 
            <img src="Images/InterviewPic3.JPG" alt="starter" width="1000" height="500">
            <p>So after owning the car for the six months he’s had it, he was able to install both the engine and transmission himself, adding coilovers, and an adjustable angle kit, it gives Antonio and his car the necessary edge he needs to drift this car into the next track meet. </p>

            <p>WIth Antonio’s 350z still being a bit new as far as him owning it. I as well as countless others wish him the best with the added modifications he may wish to have to have the car drift ready for the future as well as be able to take on the streets as a daily driver.</p>
